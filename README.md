TinyPiOS
TinyPiOS is an experimental project aimed at building a basic bootloader and a minimal operating system for the Raspberry Pi. This serves as an educational endeavor to understand the low-level workings of operating systems and bootloaders on ARM-based architectures.

Features
Bootloader Development: Crafting a simple bootloader in ARM assembly to initialize the Raspberry Pi hardware.

Minimal OS Kernel: Developing a basic kernel to handle fundamental operations post-boot.

Assembly Language: Utilizing ARM assembly for low-level hardware interaction and control.
